# PEITHO - Perfecting Experiments with Information Theory

## MOTIVATION
Different experiments provide differing levels of information about a biological system.
This makes it difficult, a priori, to select one of them beyond mere speculation and/or
belief, especially when resources are limited. Herein we present PEITH(Θ), a general
purpose, command line interface built in Python, and developed to tackle the problem
of experimental selection using information theory. PEITH(Θ) extends the work of Liepe
et al. [1] giving users the capability to simulate a range of experiments and make a
selection beyond guesswork.

## MANUAL

The manual provides an easy to follow installation procedure, technical background information and detailed instructions on how to use PEITH(Θ).
